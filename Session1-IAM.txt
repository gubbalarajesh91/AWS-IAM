IAM for security topic
IAM --> Identity access management
Authentication --> you should prove you belong to the system
Authorization --> you should prove you belong to that particular resource

There are list
User---> Usually a human
Group---> Team or group of team like developer, admins, etc. group represents similar roles and responsibilities
Permissions---> What a user/group can do
    what action we can perform on which resource

identity = user or group = entity

resource/services(nouns)= EC2, S3, Route53, RDS, etc..

Actions = What you can do on that resource

CURD----> Create update Read Delete 
Read will not create damage
